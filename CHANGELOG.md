and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-14
### Added
- Added feature to save the generated mesh as an FBX file. Just select the GameObject, (at the top) click on SplineMesh > Export Selected to FBX. Added `SplineMeshExporter.cs` file (Editor Menu Item) for this feature. This feature requires FBX Exporter package as a dependency and will be very useful.
- Added feature to save the GameObject as a prefab. Useful if you want to spawn the mesh manually. Select the GameObject, (at the top) click on SplineMesh > Save Selected as Prefab. Added `SplineMeshPrefabSaver.cs` file (Editor Menu Item) for this feature.
- Added URP materials to samples.

### Changed
- Updated `package.json` to include Unity's FBX Exporter package as a dependency. Now this package will be installed automatically when installing through the Package Manager.
- Update `SplineMesh.cs` to check for more null conditions before generating spline. Earlier, when the Spline Container is not null, but contained splines initially, but then if it was removed, would cause the package to break. Now it checks a lot more things before mesh generation.
- Updated `SplineMesh.cs` and `SplineMeshResolution.cs` to include High Density Meshes. This is needed if the generated mesh has more than 65,535 vertices.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-05-19

### Added
- Added feature to twist the spline mesh based on the rotation of the knots
- Spline mesh can now be twisted by enabling this "Should Twist Mesh" Boolean in the Inspector. Feature available for both SplineMesh and SplineMeshResolution scripts.

### Changed
- Updated `package.json`
